1.Construct all the Binary tree having node from 1 - n.
  We are gvien a number N , we haver to construct all the binary tree having node value from 1 -   n . Ex : N = 3.
  output : We have to print the inorder travseral of all the Binary tree formed.
2.Given an array of driver's ratings over N days.
  Value over a period = (Contiuous sum * Minimum rating in that period)
  eg: [3, 1, 6, 4, 5, 2]
  Value could be (3+1+6+4+5+2) * 1 = 21.
  eg: [3, 1, 6, 4, 5, 2]
  Find the maximum value.
  Here max value is (6+4+5) * 4 = 60.
